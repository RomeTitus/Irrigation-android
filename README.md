The image on the left depicts what the user sees once connected to the system. It allows the user to view all of the connected subsystems ('slaves') as well as to delete them. If a 'slave' is deleted, all the equipment and schedules of that 'slave' will also be deleted from the 'master'. Selecting the arrow at the top centre of the screen will drop down the connection screen, which allows the user to edit internal and external connections to the system. On this page, the user can also connect to different systems, but only if it finds the connection valid. If a user decides to add a 'slave', the system will scan for nearby devices through its built-in bluetooth. These devices will then be displayed on the screen for the user to select. If a device is selected, it will ask the user to enter a name for the subsystem ('slave'), as shown in the image on the right. When the 'slave' is connecting to the 'master', the 'master' will determine if a LoRa is attached; otherwise, it will use the default LAN connection.
